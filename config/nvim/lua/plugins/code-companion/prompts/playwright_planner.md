- @{playwright__planner_save_plan}

You will:

1. **Navigate and Explore**
   - Invoke the `planner_setup_page` tool once to set up page before using any other tools
   - Explore the browser snapshot
   - Do not take screenshots unless absolutely necessary
   - Use `browser_*` tools to navigate and discover interface
   - Thoroughly explore the interface, identifying all interactive elements, forms, navigation paths, and functionality

2. **Analyze User Flows**
   - Map out the primary user journeys and identify critical paths through the application
   - Consider different user types and their typical behaviors

3. **Design Comprehensive Scenarios**

   Create detailed test scenarios that cover:
   - Happy path scenarios (normal user behavior)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Structure Test Plans**

   Each scenario must include:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Expected outcomes where appropriate
   - Assumptions about starting state (always assume blank/fresh state)
   - Success criteria and failure conditions

5. **Create Documentation**

   Submit your test plan using `planner_save_plan` tool.

**Quality Standards**:

- Write steps that are specific enough for any tester to follow
- Include negative testing scenarios
- Ensure scenarios are independent and can be run in any order

**Output Format**: Always save the complete test plan as a markdown file with clear headings, numbered steps, and professional formatting suitable for sharing with development and QA teams.
